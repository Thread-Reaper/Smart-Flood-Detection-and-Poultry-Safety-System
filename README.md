# Smart Flood Detection and Poultry Safety System

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Smart Flood Detection and Poultry Safety System, designed to protect poultry from flooding in farm environments. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to monitor water levels in real-time, automatically raising a platform to keep chickens safe when floodwaters rise. Additionally, the system features LED control based on light intensity, providing automatic illumination in low-light conditions.

## Features:
- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring**: Uses an ultrasonic sensor for accurate detection of water levels.
- **Automated Platform Adjustment**: Adjusts the platform height based on water level readings to protect poultry from flooding.
- **Alarm System**: Activates an alarm to alert farm staff when water levels exceed safe limits.
- **LED Control with LDR**: Two LEDs are connected to an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), which turns the LEDs on when light intensity is low and off when it's high.
- **Arduino Integration**: Built on an Arduino platform for effective control and automation.

## Usage:
