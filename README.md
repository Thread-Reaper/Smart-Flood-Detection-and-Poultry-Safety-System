# Smart Flood Detection and Poultry Safety System

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Smart Flood Detection and Poultry Safety System, designed to protect poultry from flooding in farm environments. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to monitor water levels in real-time, automatically raising a platform to keep chickens safe when floodwaters rise. 

## Features:
- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring**: Uses an ultrasonic sensor for accurate detection of water levels.
- **Automated Platform Adjustment**: Adjusts the platform height based on water level readings.
- **Alarm System**: Activates an alarm to alert farm staff when water levels exceed safe limits.
- **Arduino Integration**: Built on an Arduino platform for effective control and automation.

## Installation and Usage:
Instructions for setting up the system and running the code can be found in the documentation folder.

## Demo Video:
